# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Divyanka Raj  

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
I built this using **React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion** to showcase who I am, what Iâ€™ve learned, and the projects Iâ€™m proud of.

## ðŸŒŸ What youâ€™ll find here
- A quick snapshot of my **skills** in programming and web development  
- My **education journey** and relevant coursework  
- Some **projects** Iâ€™ve worked on (including real-time interview prep & wellness apps)  
- **Certifications** Iâ€™ve earned along the way  
- Easy ways to **connect with me** (LinkedIn, GitHub, email)

## ðŸ’¡ Why this portfolio?
I wanted a space that feels modern and clean â€” where you can get to know me at a glance.  
Itâ€™s not just about listing skills, but giving a little story of my growth as a developer.
